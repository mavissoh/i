NOTE: I had to downgrade the Flask version from 2b onwards, as the newer version of Flask (used in 2a) was 
not compatible with MongoDB (as flask-mongoengine was outdated). I can very barely remember what code was 
changed specifically to align with the Flask version downgrade because I was trying to implement MongoDB 
alongside fixing the Flask codes, so there might be some changes undocumented. Both versions are still using 
Bootstrap 5 though (different from Staycationâ€™s Bootstrap 4). You may identify the changes better in my GitHub 
commits (hopefully).

you can start the application with
flask --debug run
instead of start.sh
